# Battle-City-python
Battle City (1990) recreation in Pygame (Python), but with a very intellegent AI enemy

**The game is forked from [KingsAlpaca/BattleCity](https://github.com/KingsAlpaca/BattleCity)**

**AI is made by me**

**Still in development, the game doesn't have the AI yet and is not even a game now**
